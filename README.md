# Generic Cart
Generic Cart web app is made with Django and vanilla JavaScript. Tailwind looks. I left a default Django db.sqlite3 with a few products added in the repository for the test purposes. 

- User Register and Login
- Registered user cart functionality
- Guest cart functionality

> Note: if you are having problems with the guest cart on a localhost - clean the csrf_token cookie that could have been saved in your browser from another localhost project.
