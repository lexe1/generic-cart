# Generic Cart
Generic Cart web app is made with Django and vanilla JavaScript to update the shopping cart items, prices and quantity dynamically.  
I left a default Django db.sqlite3 with a few products added in the repository for the test purposes. Tailwind looks.

- User Register and Login
- Registered user cart functionality
- Guest cart functionality

> Note: if you are having problems with the guest cart - clean the csrf_token cookie that could have been saved in your browser from another localhost project.
